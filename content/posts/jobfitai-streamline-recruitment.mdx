  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
    Recruitment is a critical yet time-consuming process for businesses. Companies often face challenges such as sifting through a mountain of resumes, ensuring candidates meet job-specific criteria, and eliminating unconscious bias. JobfitAI was created to address these challenges and empower businesses with smarter hiring solutions.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
    In this post, I’ll walk you through how JobfitAI helps businesses save time, reduce costs, and hire top talent more effectively.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold font-extrabold mt-8">Automated Resume Screening</h2>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
    Sorting through hundreds of resumes manually is inefficient and prone to errors. JobfitAI automates this process, ensuring businesses focus on the best-fit candidates.
  </p>

  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-2">Benefits</h3>
  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-lg mb-4">
    <li><strong>Time Savings:</strong> JobfitAI screens resumes in seconds, reducing the hiring process from weeks to days.</li>
    <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Resumes are ranked based on predefined criteria like skills, qualifications, and experience levels.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-2">Example</h3>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
    A tech startup used JobfitAI to screen over 500 applicants for a developer role. The system identified the top 10 candidates within hours, significantly speeding up their hiring timeline.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold font-extrabold mt-8">Customizable Criteria for Better Matches</h2>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
    Every job role is unique, and so are its requirements. JobfitAI allows businesses to define specific criteria to rank candidates.
  </p>

  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-2">Benefits</h3>
  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-lg mb-4">

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold font-extrabold mt-8">Reducing Hiring Bias</h2>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
